Hello,

I'm Juliette from Berlin. My repo is all about JavaScript and CSS.  
I have a bachelor's degree in media informatics. Last year I took a modern web development course and trained a lot on Scrimba, a web developer platform.
This year I programmed some projects. Please visit my website https://www.salevsky.net

With kind regards
